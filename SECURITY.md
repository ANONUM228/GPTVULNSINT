## Reporting a Vulnerability

I take the security of GPTVULNSINT seriously. If you find a security vulnerability, please **do not open a public issue**. 

Instead, please use the **"Report a vulnerability"** button located under the **Security** tab of this repository.

### What happens next?
1. I will receive a private notification.
2. We will discuss the details in a private advisory.
3. Once the fix is ready, I will merge the patch and give you credit for the find.

Thank you for keeping GPTVULNSINT safe!
